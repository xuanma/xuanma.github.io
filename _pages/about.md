I'm a research assistant professor at Northwestern University, Chicago, United States. I earned my PhD from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2017, where I worked with [Prof. Jiping He](https://search.asu.edu/profile/49553) and established a nonhuman primate lab from scratch. I then moved to the US and joined [Prof. Lee Miller's lab](https://miller-limblab.squarespace.com) at Northwestern University as a postdoc, where I investigate how neurons in the brain orchestrates hand movements to advance the development of a brain-controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) brain-computer interface (BCI).

**I am an experimental neuroscientist** dedicated to understanding the neural mechanisms that govern body movements, with the goal of developing engineering solutions such as BCI to assist individuals with motor impairments. My research involves recording large-scale neural activity during diverse motor behaviors using advanced electrophysiological tools, including floating microelectrode arrays (FMAs), Utah electrode arrays, and Neuropixels probes.

**I am also a computational neuroscientist**. I am passionate about using machine learning tools to decipher complex neural recordings. My research focuses on understanding neural manifolds underlying motor control, leveraging various dimensionality reduction techniques to reveal their structure and dynamics. I also develop advanced computational methods to enhance BCI performance, making them more robust to across-day neural drifts and adaptable to variations in task demands.

I am a tech enthusiast, too. I have built my own DDS signal generators and oscilloscopes using FPGAs. I had designed a fully implantable epidural spinal cord stimulator (ESCS) leveraging wireless power transmission technology.

Outside of work, I love traveling and exploring new places. To me, life is a journey, and I want to experience as much of it as possible.
