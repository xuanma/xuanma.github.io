Neural mechanisms of grasping force control
====================
Grasping is a fundamental skill in primates, yet many aspects of its neural control remain unknown. While previous studies have explored various aspects of grasping, questions persistâ€”particularly regarding how cortical neurons regulate the generation and maintenance of grasping forces. A major challenge in studying this process is that the neurons controlling hand muscles are densely concentrated within the folded regions of the central sulcus, making it difficult to capture large-scale neural recordings using Utah arrays or conventional probes.

In this ongoing project, I use Neuropixels NHP long probes to record neural activity across different depths and locations in M1 while training a monkey to perform interactive grasping tasks with a robotic arm. Through this approach, I aim to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying grasping force control and investigate how the motor cortex interacts with sensory areas during this process.
