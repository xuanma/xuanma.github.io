Structure of neural manifolds underlying diverse motor behaviors
====================
Neural activity is inherently complex and high-dimensional. However, rather than spanning the entire high-dimensional state space—where each axis represents the activity of a single neuron—neural activity at population level is often confined to a low-dimensional subspace. This structured organization provides a simplified and interpretable framework for analyzing neural dynamics, offering insights into how the brain efficiently encodes and processes information.

Identifying the neural manifold for a single motor task is relatively straightforward, but the broader picture across a repertoire of behaviors remains unclear. Does a nonlinear “uber manifold” exist, encompassing multiple behaviors? Are different behaviors organized into distinct regions of this manifold, or do they overlap? Over the years, I have collected a vast dataset of neural recordings from experiments where animals performed a diverse range of sensorimotor tasks, including continuous, freeform movements in minimally constrained environments. With these rich datasets, I believe we are well-positioned to answer these fundamental questions about the structure and organization of neural manifolds in motor control.

Neural mechanisms of grasping force control
====================
Grasping is a fundamental skill in primates, yet many aspects of its neural control remain unknown. While previous studies have explored various aspects of grasping, questions persist—particularly regarding how cortical neurons regulate the generation and maintenance of grasping forces. A major challenge in studying this process is that the neurons controlling hand muscles are densely concentrated within the folded regions of the central sulcus, making it difficult to capture large-scale neural recordings using Utah arrays or conventional probes.

In this ongoing project, I use Neuropixels NHP long probes to record neural activity across different depths and locations in M1 while training a monkey to perform interactive grasping tasks with a robotic arm. Through this approach, I aim to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying grasping force control and investigate how the motor cortex interacts with sensory areas during this process.

Robust brain computer interface (BCI) that can work across time, tasks and subjects
====================
BCIs hold great promise for restoring motor control and communication in individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, for BCIs to become truly practical and seamlessly integrate into users’ daily lives, they must exhibit greater adaptability and long-term stability across different tasks and individuals. Current systems, however, often struggle with these demands, requiring frequent recalibration for new tasks.

Alongside my fantastic colleagues, I have been working to address these challenges. We are developing advanced computational approaches—ranging from simple linear algebra techniques to deep neural networks—to achieve stable neural decoding that remains robust over time, across individuals, and across multiple tasks. Our goal is to build more intelligent BCIs that can generalize effectively and function reliably in real-world applications.
